# Adobe Image Classification and Artifact Detection

The rise of advanced AI image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and Generative Adversarial Networks, has transformed content creation. However, it also presents significant challenges in ensuring content authenticity and reliability.

We propose a lightweight and efficient hybrid model that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Data-efficient Image Transformers (DeiT)** for AI-generated image detection. This approach utilizes CNNs to capture fine-grained local features and DeiTs to extract robust global representations, resulting in high accuracy, low latency, and reduced model size, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Beyond detection, we focus on enhancing transparency and user confidence by identifying and explaining artifacts that differentiate AI-generated images from real ones. By leveraging **vision-language models (VLMs)** and multimodal embeddings, our method detects artifacts such as unnatural textures or blending and generates concise, human-readable explanations.

This combination of accuracy and interpretability provides a scalable and trustworthy solution for addressing the challenges posed by AI-generated media across diverse applications.
